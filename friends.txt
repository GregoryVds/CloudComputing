How to run the extra job to get the set of immediate neighbors:

You can run the job in isolation, using the exact same arguments as the evaluate task.
This isolated task is called "neighbors".

For example:
"./run.sh neighbors outputIterationX out 1 5 1"

Or you can also run the job as a composite task, using the exact same arguments as the composite task.
This composited task is called "neighborsComposite".

For example:
"./run.sh neighborsComposite input output 1 12 4 1"
